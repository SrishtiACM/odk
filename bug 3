Sync sometimes backs you out when finishing or failing its sync process


Software and hardware versions

ODK 2.0 RC1, Nexus 6, Android 6. I was reproing with the cold chain demo, but I don't think it matters.

Problem description

When syncing, as the process nears completion sometimes it will back you out to the previous screen.
You then have to open up the sync UI again to see what the result was.

Steps to reproduce the problem

Authenticate and synchronize to a server. You don't need to by syncing new changes, you can just keep hitting sync and eventually one of them will pop you out. It seems to be more frequent on older hardware.

Expected behavior

The sync UI should never back you out or finish unless you press a button indicating you want that.
